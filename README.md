# django-manage

A simple shell script for django which lets you run *manage.py* in your project
root with imported *python virtual environment*.

The virtual environment **needs** to be in the **venv** or **python-venv**
directory in the project-root-path or in its parent directory.

To use the script copy the *manage* file to the root directory of your django
project. You don't need to copy the *LICENSE* file to your project, hence the
manage file contains the copyright notice.

If you edit the *manage* file, keep the copyright notice in the file and add
your onw copyright for the changes if you publish it.
